# RaptorsAPIProject
Creating a nifty webpage that will display various Sharingans from the Naruto anime and then load some information about the user from the Naruto API and populate them on Materialize CSS cards. 

This project will be using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and Materiize CSS. 

***UPDATE 6/10/2021***

I realized late into the project that the narutoAPI would not mesh well with my current skill set, it appears to use a different coding language. I decided to re-route the project to be about the Toronto Raptors, and managed to find an API that had data on the players. The API is called api-nba a google search should locate it. 

I was able to re-use a lot of the old materialize CSS and converted all of the manual coded player elements from HTML to JS.
